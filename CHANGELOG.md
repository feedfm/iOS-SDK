  - This is the first non-beta release of our SDK with offline playback support. See
    our [offline documentation](https://developer.feed.fm/docs/offline) for details
    on how this works.
  - We are deprecating the methods in `FMAudioPlayer` that let you search for stations
    (`getStationWithOptions`, `getStationWithOptionKey:Value:`, e.t.c.), and instead
    we've created a new subclass of NSArray 
    ([FMStationAray](http://feed.fm/sdk/docs/ios/latest/html/Classes/FMStationArray.html))
    that has methods to let you search for stations based on their metadata. The `FMAudioPlayer`
    properties `stationList`, `localOfflineStationList`, and `remoteOfflineStationList`
    implement that class.
  - whenAvailable:notAvailable: was holding on to its callbacks too long.
